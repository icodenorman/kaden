    <h1>gojo</h1>
   <h2>My mythical creature is gojo, He's absurdly 
    powerful, even within the world of "Jujutsu Kaisen."
     His ability, "Six Eyes," grants him heightened
      perception, while "Limitless" allows him to 
      manipulate space at will. These powers make 
      him virtually unbeatable in combat.</h2>
      <h2>He's charismatic, witty, and often acts
         nonchalantly, even in serious situations.
          He's confident to the point of arrogance
           but backs it up with his strength and
            intelligence.</h2>
            <h2>As a teacher at Tokyo Metropolitan Curse
                 Technical College, he's unconventional,
                  often putting his students in 
                  dangerous situations to force them to
                   grow. However, he genuinely cares 
                   about their development and is
                    willing to protect them at any 
                    cost.</h2>
